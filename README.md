ElectroMol Studio
=================

The Photoshop of in-silico molecular chemistry.

Designed to be accessible and useful to everyone from high school chemistry students to pioneering researchers, scientists and doctors.

Important information will bubble up to this ReadMe. For now, please look at the Milestones section.

Design goals
------------
* A single portable executable Java JAR file, no install or external libraries necessary
  1. You: not Java! No!
  2. Me: buy me a MacBook Air, then we'll talk about OS X. Free as in freedom means not just the source is free, but that it runs on the computers at public libraries.
* Does not require administrator privileges
* Not really a design goal, but it's dedicated to the public domain (http://unlicense.org)

Impetus
-------
I believe that this tool will help me (& whoever else wants to contribute/participate) to implement a repeatable formula for developing effective cancer-prevention therapies, at least for most cancers caused by carcinogens (as opposed to natural cell breakdown):
* identify oncogene of a type of cancer I want to prevent
* identify a carcinogen that binds to the oncogene
* develop a non-carcinogenic medicine that binds to the oncogene, protecting the oncogene from the carcinogen
