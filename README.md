ElectroMol-Studio
=================

The Photoshop of in-silico molecular chemistry.

Designed to be accessible and useful to everyone from high school chemistry students to pioneering researchers, scientists and doctors.

Important information will bubble up to this ReadMe. For now, please look at the Milestones section.

The impetus for this tool is a need for a repeatable procedure to design therapies to effectively prevent carcinogen-induced cancers.

Design goals:

* A single portable executable Java JAR file, no install or external libraries necessary
* Does not require administrator privileges
* Not really a design goal, but it's dedicated to the public domain (http://unlicense.org)
